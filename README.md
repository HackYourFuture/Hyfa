Hyfa (HackYourFuture Assistant) is an AI-powered Slack bot designed to serve as a virtual mentor for HackYourFuture.

Hyfa provides guidance, support, and resources to trainees throughout their coding journey, helping them navigate the curriculum and overcome technical challenges while encouraging independent problem-solving and growth.

### What Hyfa Can Help With

- Understanding web development concepts (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, React.js, databases)
- Providing hints and guidance for coding problems without giving away complete solutions
- Offering advice on study methods and debugging strategies
- Supporting job search preparation, including CV building and interview tips
- Answering general questions about life in the Netherlands

Hyfa is designed to be accessible, friendly, and professional â€“ always ready to assist but careful to empower students to develop their own problem-solving skills.

### How to use Hyfa
* You can send a private message to @hyfa at any time and she will respond in no time. 

* If Hyfa is a member of a Slack channel (private or public), you can tag her with @hyfa to get her attention to your question, she will look at the recent channel messages and try to provide the best answer.

* You can also tag @hyfa inside a Slack thread if you want her to join the conversation. Threads only work for group channels

* Creating a private group with multiple trainees? Why not adding Hyfa to help out if needed
